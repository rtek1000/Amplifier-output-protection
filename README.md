Thermal protection for class AB amplifier output transistors

- Most class AB amplifiers built with NPN and PNP transistors are very poor in protection.
- - Some designs put a simple current limiter, but this does not guarantee the thermal protection of the transistor.
- - Some amplifier manufacturers use a fixed mechanical thermostat of about 100Â°C against the heatsink.

The partial scheme of an amplifier can be seen below,
- Where there is the current limiting transistor (T10),
- The resistor 0R33 (R37) serves as a reference to monitor the current of the output transistor (T16).
- The other output transistors (T18, T20) are not monitored.
- In this type of circuit, all transistors are expected to have a similar current gain.

------

The circuit of Thermal protection is based on the TL431 which is widely used in switching power supplies, this IC is very reliable:
- Each output transistor must have a 10k B3950 NTC sensor.
- The relay output can be used to jumper the signal input of amplifier.

The main schematic shows several blocks "NTC_sensor" so that each transistor can be monitored independently:
- If the amplifier has 20 output transistors, 20 blocks are needed.

To fix the NTC on the transistor, STARS-922 thermal glue can be used.
