Thermal protection for class AB amplifier output transistors

- Most class AB amplifiers built with NPN and PNP transistors are very poor in protection. Some designs put a simple current limiter, but this does not guarantee the thermal protection of the transistor.

The circuit is based on the TL431 which is widely used in switching power supplies, this IC is very reliable.
- Each output transistor must have a 10k B3950 NTC sensor.
- The relay output can be used to jumper the signal input.
- - Some amplifier manufacturers use a fixed mechanical thermostat of about 100Â°C against the heatsink.
