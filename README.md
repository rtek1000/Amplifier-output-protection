Thermal protection for class AB amplifier output transistors

- Most class AB amplifiers built with NPN and PNP transistors are very poor in protection.
- - Some designs put a simple current limiter, but this does not guarantee the thermal protection of the transistor.

The partial scheme of an amplifier can be seen below,
- Where there is the current limiting transistor (T10),
- The resistor 0R33 (R37) serves as a reference to monitor the current of the output transistor (T16).
- The other output transistors (T18, T20) are not monitored.

The circuit of Thermal protection is based on the TL431 which is widely used in switching power supplies, this IC is very reliable.
- Each output transistor must have a 10k B3950 NTC sensor.
- The relay output can be used to jumper the signal input.
- - Some amplifier manufacturers use a fixed mechanical thermostat of about 100Â°C against the heatsink.

The main schematic shows several blocks "NTC_sensor" so that each transistor can be monitored independently:
- If the amplifier has 20 output transistors, 20 blocks are needed.
